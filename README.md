Create the text file:

  Create a file named emails.txt in the same directory as your script.
  Paste your email addresses into this file, with each address on a new line.

Run the script:

  Copy the script above into a new file and save it as convert_to_csv.py (or any name you prefer).
  Open a terminal or command prompt.
  Navigate to the directory where your script and emails.txt are located.
  Run the script with the command:
  
```python convert_to_csv.py```

Ensure that your email addresses are correctly formatted in the emails.txt file.
